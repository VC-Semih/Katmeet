# Katmeet how to setup

First launch

```bash
$ npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify configure (if you never used amplify only)
$ amplify init
$ amplify push
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run
```

If aws is already online

```bash
$ npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli
$ amplify init
$ amplify pull

```

> Ensure you have an emulator running or device attached before running `flutter run`.
